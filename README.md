# Upgrade Equipment, trying to be done up by Nyxxonial...
trying to be fixed by Nyxx but failing quite a bit right now because of lack of effort to deconstruct calamity.

## current attempts at fixes...
- Change base code of 'PostReforge' to 'PreReforge' this enables the mod to work again with calamity BUT items still lose upgrade when reforged after application, so I'll see if i can find a way to fix that..

### current plans for the future..
- ReWrite mod for 1.4 TmodLoader
- Figure out why calam is beating the mod up..
- Tweak certain stat increases and allow for overpowered weapons again
- Eventually use said rewritten code and implement it into a potential larger mod (currently in speculation)
- Gain the attention of the other two devs...  HI!!

If either of you want to talk about this mod, or any changes I've made/plan on making hit me up over on discord ; Nyxxonial#9999

# hrr_ Version of readme
# Upgrade Equipment (hrr\_)

Upgrade Equipment (hrr_) is a watered-down, tweaked version of oempa's Upgrade Equipment Mod.

Kill mobs and bosses for Upgrade Tokens, then use them to upgrade your weapons at the Upgrader NPC!

# Differences from oempa's Version:
- Support for any damage type! - probably
- Fixed compatibility issue with newer Calamity versions but ITEMS WILL LOSE THEIR UPGRADE WHEN REFORGING (when playing with Calamity)
- Rebalanced damage / crit chance / speed increases entirely - weapons will still be strong, but not nearly as broken overpowered
- Removed size / knockback / velocity / mana increases entirely
- Rebalanced upgrade token drop amounts
- Rebalanced upgrading costs
